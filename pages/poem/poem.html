  <p class="poem">
    <i><br>On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job to do.
  <br>With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the masterpiece on the
  wall above.
  <br>First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of here,
  but not too far.
  <br>Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for
  horses, business was good.
  <br>Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a
  quarter any old time.
  <br>Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador,
  a speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall”
  <br>Paintings were rolled and stored away,
  for twelve long years in the dust they lay.
  <br>At last came nineteen thirty-three,
  the law was repealed and Bacchus was free.
  <br>Saloons and taverns opened their doors,
  folks danced, sang, and drank spirits once more.
  <br>The old bar was hauled out of
  its storage place, and the paintings were hung on the walls they now grace.
  <br>The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still enjoy them
  as much as they do.</i></p>
