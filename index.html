<h1 class="welcome">WELCOME TO THE AMBASSADOR</h1>
<p class="welcomemessage"><br>This Upper Peninsula eatery is known for great food (including one-of-a-kind
  pizza), but that’s not all that sets it apart. The walls are covered in
  breathtaking murals and the light fixtures glow with bright colors. Don't
  let its simple exterior fool you: the Ambassador is an absolute must-see.</br>

<br>The Upper Peninsula's lunch options don't stop at the pasty though, just ask
the Ambassador in Houghton. Featuring salads, nachos, sandwiches and pasta,
it's a great lunch stop. The king of the Ambassador's offerings, however, is
its tostada pizza. Essentially a massive taco in pizza form, this wonder of
lunch features ground beef, white colby cheese, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato,
and hot sauce all in one.</br></p>

<h1 class="menu">MENU</h1>

<h1 class="ourhistory">OUR HISTORY</h1>
<div>
  <p class="historytext" id="hist"><br>On January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant opened under new ownership.
  The new owners, the Rossi family, had transformed the space from a tap bar
  into a restaurant that specialized in pizza and sandwiches. In 1978, the
  Ambassador was expanded into the space next door, and the second dining room
  was added. In January 2007, the Ambassador became a non-smoking establishment.
  To explain the history of the Ambassador and the unique murals that line the
  interior walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem detailing the
  story. The poem, entitled "Come Fill a Bumper," has since been printed on the
  cover of the Ambassador menu.</br>


  <br>The first line of the poem mentions "Mr. Rohrbeck," who was “given a job to do.”
Rohrbeck, the mural artist, was commissioned by Joseph Bosch (born in Baden,
Germany in 1850) to paint the murals specifically for the Bosch brewery (closed
in 1978). The murals were later placed in the "old Giltedge Bar." Featuring
gnomes in various states of celebration, the murals are oil on canvas, with
several coats of varnish on top for preservation. The date that the paintings
were sold to the Ambassador and transferred from the Bosch Brewery is unclear,
but the transaction likely took place in the late 40s or early 50s during a
remodeling project.</br>

<br>The Ambassador retains the original charm and tradition of its original
inception; in addition to the murals, which have remained in place for over
50 years, the original pizza recipe is still used to create the Ambassador pizzas.</br>
